# Bytepad

Bytepad is a lightweight, terminal-based text editor written in C, built from scratch following the spirit of [Salvatore Sanfilippo's (antirez) Kilo](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/). It's designed to be minimal yet functional, offering a hands-on learning experience in low-level programming and terminal manipulation.


***Note: This project is still under construction.***


## Inspiration
This project follows the step-by-step approach of the Kilo text editor tutorial (like the one at viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/), inspired by antirez's [original work](github.com/antirez/kilo). It's a playground for learning terminal I/O, C programming, and the beauty of simplicity.
